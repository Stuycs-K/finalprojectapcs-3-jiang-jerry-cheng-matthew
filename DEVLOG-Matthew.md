### 2025-05-27 - Edited Piece class to display pieces
Spent an hour figuring out the colors for the pieces as well as randomizing the process of choosing the pieces. I also stored the coordinates of each tile in an array, so when I displayed each tile, it would be easier to access. The scale of the square size to coordinates was also taken into account. 

The displayTile method was written to display each tile, and by showing each tile, the entire piece would be drawn/represented.

### 2025-05-28 - Edited Piece class by fixing coordinates
Spent time changing the coordinates of each pieces as some pieces had the wrong coordinates.
Also changed my coordinate scaling by adjusting based off of tile display method
