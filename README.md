# Project Description

This project is a version of the popular game Tetris. It is a fully functional processing sketch. The board size is 10 x 20, and the screen size is bigger to display the hold piece as well as score. The game ends if you top out. There are random pieces, generated from a set of 7 pieces, which start falling down. Full rows ( complete lines ) would be deleted and whatever is on top would be shifted down.

# Intended usage:

A description as to how the project will be used (describe the user interface). (CHANGE THIS!!!!!)
