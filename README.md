# Project Description

This project is a version of the popular game Tetris. It is a fully functional processing sketch. The board size is 10 x 20, and the screen size is bigger to display the hold piece as well as score. The game ends if you top out. There are random pieces, generated from a set of 7 pieces, which start falling down. Full rows ( complete lines ) would be deleted and whatever is on top would be shifted down.

# Intended usage:

In order to move, you have to use the keys ‘a’ and ‘d’ to move left and right respectively. 


To rotate, use the keys ‘j’ and ‘k’ to rotate counterclockwise and clockwise respectively. 



In order to hold, use the ‘h’ key which stores the current piece for later use.


To soft drop, use the ‘s’ key, and this will increase the gravity of the current piece by 3x while the key is held. 


To hard drop, use the spacebar key, and this drops the current piece to wherever it is hovering over (you can see where it’s hovering with the implementation of the ghost piece). 



Note that the keys only work in the lowercase form, basically it is case sensitive, so if you accidentally turn on caps lock, none of the controls will work.


Clearing a single gives you 40 points


Clearing a double gives you 100 points


Clearing a triple gives you 300 points


Clearing a tetris gives you 1340 points



A cheat code that we added was that if you clicked with the left side of your mouse, it would change the current piece to another random piece.
