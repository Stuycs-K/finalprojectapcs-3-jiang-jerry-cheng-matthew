Brief project description:
- This project would be a copy of the popular game Tetris. It would be a fully functional processing sketch. We will have a board size of 10 x 20, the screen size will be bigger to possibly display the next piece and display score. Game ends if top out. Random pieces, generated from a 7 piece bag system, would start falling down. You have to place pieces to avoid topping out. Complete lines would be deleted and whatever is on top would be shifted down.

Expanded description:
- Critical Features (MVP) :
  - rotations, several functional pieces, game over check, gravity, deletion of complete rows, keybinds
- Diagrams:

- Nice to have Features:
  - speed ramping up as game continues, point scoring system, storing a tetris piece to use later, showing what piece comes next, changing keybinds, custom pieces
