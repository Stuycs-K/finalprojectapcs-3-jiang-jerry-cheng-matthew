2) Copy of suika game (link: https://suikagame.com)
You drop fruits into a box, when two of the same fruit touch, it merges into a higher tier fruit, with each higher tier fruit taking up more space. When two watermelon touch, it
disappears. There is a score counter and a "next box" that shows the fruit that comes up next. You lose when you exceed the height of the box. This game would also include gravity
simulation as well as collision. Also the fruits different shapes so the collision would be different from each fruit.
