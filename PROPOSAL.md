# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Matthew Cheng && Jerry Jiang

# IDEAS:

1) Our first proposal is tetris. We will have a board size of 10 x 20, the screen size will be bigger to possibly dispaly the next piece and display score. Set a score value for
specific line clears. Only basic spins. Gravity constant no matter level, game ends if top out; possibly doing back to back chains. Random piece generated but will be a 7 piece bag system

2) Copy of suika game (link: https://suikagame.com)
You drop fruits into a box, when two of the same fruit touch, it merges into a higher tier fruit, with each higher tier fruit taking up more space. When two watermelon touch, it
disappears. There is a score counter and a "next box" that shows the fruit that comes up next. You lose when you exceed the height of the box. This game would also include gravity
simulation as well as collision. Also the fruits different shapes so the collision would be different from each fruit.

3 statement of the problem you are solving and/or a high level description of the project. (CHANGE THIS!!!!!)
