# Final Project Proposal

## Group Members:

Matthew Cheng && Jerry Jiang

# IDEAS:

1) Our first proposal is tetris. We will have a board size of 10 x 20, the screen size will be bigger to possibly dispaly the next piece and display score. Set a score value for
specific line clears. Only basic spins. Gravity constant no matter level, game ends if top out; possibly doing back to back chains. Random piece generated but will be a 7 piece bag system
